### Involvement API

- **Base URL**: `https://us-central1-involvement-api.cloudfunctions.net/capstoneApi/`
- To generate a unique identifier, send a POST action to `Base URL` + `/apps/`. (No parameters required);

- Return value: unique identifier for the app
```

```

- To create a new like for a given item, send a POST action to `Base URL` + `/apps/` + `:id` + `/likes/`. E.g: `Base URL/apps/Zl4d7IVkemOTTVg2fUdz/likes/`. Example of request body:
```
{ 
   "item_id": "item1"
}
```

- To create a new comment for a given item, send a POST action to `Base URL` + `/apps/` + `:id` + `/comments/`. E.g: `Base URL/apps/Zl4d7IVkemOTTVg2fUdz/comments/`. Example of request body:
